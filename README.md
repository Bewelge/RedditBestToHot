# RedditBestToHot Chrome Extension
Chrome extension to redirect reddit.com to reddit.com/hot as well as changing the home button links.


## What it does

* Automatically Redirects you from Reddit.com to Reddit.com/hot.
* Changes the destination of the two home buttons (top bar and the Snoo) to Reddit.com/hot.

## Disclaimer

I made this because I was annoyed at the new front-page of Reddit. 

While browsing for a solution I found that I'm not the only one so I decided to share this extension. 

Be warned though that I merely took 15 minutes to make this and that it's the first extension I've ever made.

I therefore cannot guarantee a complete and professional grade extension. Use at your own risk. 
But if you understand JavaScript you can take a look at the content.js file to see that it's quite simple and straightforward.

One drawback is that you cannot reach Reddit.com while the extension is active because it will always redirect you to Reddit.com/hot.
Might change that in the future but since this is mainly for my personal use and judging by my first impression of the new front-page I don't think that I'll ever want to go there ;-)
