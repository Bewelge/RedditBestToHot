# RedditBestToHot Chrome Extension
Chrome extension to redirect reddit.com to reddit.com/hot as well as changing the home button links.

**Only works on old Design**


## What it does

* Automatically Redirects you from Reddit.com to Reddit.com/hot.
* Changes the destination of the two home buttons (top bar and the Snoo) to Reddit.com/hot.

## Disclaimer

I made this because I was annoyed at the new front-page of Reddit. 

While browsing for a solution I found that I'm not the only one so I decided to share this extension. 

Be warned though that I merely took 15 minutes to make this and that it's the first extension I've ever made.

I therefore cannot guarantee a complete and professional grade extension. Use at your own risk. 
But if you understand JavaScript you can take a look at the content.js file to see that it's quite simple and straightforward.

If you manually go to reddit.com (by clicking on 'best') you will notice your URL now reads 'Reddit.com/#best'. This is so the extension does not redirect you.
